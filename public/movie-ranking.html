<h1> The Best Movies According to Nani </h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
 <hr />

 <h3>Pan's Labyrinth</h3>
 <p>I really like the fantasy aspect of this movie. It's really sad, but interesting how the main character escapes her reality.</p>

 <h3>Spawn</h3>
 <p>I really love the comic book character Spawn. The movie was so good and I loved it as a kid.</p>

 <h3>Robinhood Men in Tights</h3>
 <p>This is such a funny movie to watch. So many dumb jokes, but I grew up with this and always quote it with my siblings and best friend.</p>
